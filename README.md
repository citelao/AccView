# AccView

A fast UIA viewer.

## TODO

* [ ] UIA calls on a separate thread!
* [ ] Structural change events (new windows, etc)
* [ ] Focus following is very buggy
* [ ] VS Code slow when open?
* [ ] Highlight items on all screens
* [ ] Highlight items when navigating by keyboard, not just hover

Features:

* [ ] Pattern exploration
  * [ ] List available
  * [ ] Text patterns!!!
* [ ] Keyboard-only nav/pause (for temporary UI)
* [ ] Caching/snapshot (for temporary UI)
* [ ] Show structural changes in element tree view
